I'm Amazing
-----------

**Technically**

-   I have built and run a few websites

    -   [Rate My Cat Poo](<http://ratemycatpoo.com>)

    -   [Rate My Dog Poo](<http://ratemydogpoo.com>)

    -   [GrinDUH](<http://grinduh.com>)

    -   [GPS Cocks](<http://www.gpscocks.com>)

    -   More currently in development including Dog and Cat Tinder..

-   I have automated my home (a bit too much)

    -   Lights (milight & Insteon) and music (slimserver) move from room to
        room, change color, dim; volume, track on command

    -   Doors (Z-wave) have open/close sensors, main door has multi-user
        key-code entry with smart deadbolt (Z-wave)

    -   Every room has security cameras (IP), motions sensors (Z-wave)

    -   Every room has a wall-mounted Android tablet for more control (and more
        motion detection)

    -   Heating & smoke detection (Nest), air conditioning (Smart Appliances)
        are all remotely addressable

    -   All of the above are integrated with a central system (Vera) that is
        programmed in Lua

    -   My cats are fed (and filmed) automatically and on-demand (Z-wave), each
        cat may only reach their own bowl (RFID).

    -   My cat's toilet reminds me to clean it (Amazon Dash + DHCP hack)

    -   I run my own DNS cache, DHCP server and intranet for simple per-device
        addressability.
